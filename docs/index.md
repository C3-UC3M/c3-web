# General Information

The UC3M Scientific Computing Center is a computing and storage service center for R&D&i groups, public research organizations, and companies involved in research and innovation.

The C3 provides computing power, storage, and technical support to its users to promote and participate in the development of research and technological development projects, as well as to contribute to the development and strengthening of its users' competitive capacity.

The C3's computers include computing and storage capacity that exceeds the resources available in standard systems, making them particularly suitable for numerical simulations, biocomputing, and artificial intelligence, given their volume of resources, both in CPUs and in reliable storage capacity.
