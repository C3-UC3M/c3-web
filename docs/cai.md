# Request Access

## How to request access to C3
1. Register as a [UC3M CAI](https://www.uc3m.es/corefacilities/new-users) user. **Important for UC3M users**: you must specify the project code for invoicing.

2. Once you are a CAI user request [CAI services](https://cai.uc3m.es/). See [this manual](https://cai.uc3m.es/media//manuales/MANUAL_CAI_LIMS_V_1.0.pdf) for help. In the description of the requested services please specify CPU hours (in thousands), GPU hours (in hundreds) and distributed storage (in TB).

3. Lastly, fill out [this form](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/formulario/c3_solicitud) for more specific information about resources and users.



## How to extend requested resources
If you need to extend the requested resources you must apply for a new service. Follow **Steps 2 and 3**.
