# Request Access

## How to request access to C3
1. Register as a [UC3M CAI](https://www.uc3m.es/corefacilities/new-users) user.

2. Once you are a CAI user request [CAI services](https://cai.uc3m.es/). See [this manual](https://cai.uc3m.es/media//manuales/MANUAL_CAI_LIMS_V_1.0.pdf) for help. In the description of the requested services please specify CPU hours (in thousands), GPU hours (in hundreds) and distributed storage (in TB).

3. Lastly, fill out [this form](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/formulario/c3_solicitud) for more specific information about resources and users.


## How to modify requested resources
If you need more or less resources than you initially estimated, or you want to change which researchers have access to your project you can request a modification by filling out [this form](https://aplicaciones.uc3m.es/formulario/c3_modificacion_solicitud). Make sure to include the complete list of resources that you need, all the users that should have access, and the form ID number of the initial form you submitted (you can find it at the bottom of the form).
